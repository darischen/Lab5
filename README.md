1) I would use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. Testing a singular feature is best using unit tests, because the feature is experimented with in isolation. There are no other factors that would affect the messaging feature if unit tests arer used.
2) I would not use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because there are two parts to sending a message above 80 characters, which is the user typing out 80 characters, and the backend sending 80 characters. To prevent the user from typing 80 characters, I would test with the frontend of the application instead of the backend, which doesn't use a unit test.
